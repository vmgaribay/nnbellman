This model was trained on 6 November 2024 after changing i_a costs to permit investment in the Low strategy and a correction was made to which_bellman() effectively inverting the selection of i_a.
This model was selected as its architecture and combination of hyperparameters produced the closest match to the results of the iterative equation. 
It is to be used with the nn_bellman_past_shock_consumption method.
